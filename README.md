# ecommerce-advanced-java

**I have used Java + JSP + Servlet + Tomcat Server + MySQL Database + Bootstrap**

1. Before moving to project just look once at **project-structure.png**

2. website-images folder contains all image of **database structure** and **website ui (flow)**

3. The JSP and html code is kept under code folder

4. The servet is in servlet folder (make sure to view project-structure.png image)

5. I haven't added any pic of items which can be done in future.

6. Feel free to clone and use it, add items with images to make it advanced.

7. If needed you can give suggestions or even fork it.. Happy Learning!
